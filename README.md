# bee_gut_bacteria

This document is a walkthrough of the methods and codes for comparative analysis of the bee gut restricted bactera, *Gilliamella* and *Snodgrassella* genomes. In the paper, we (1) annotated the genomes; (2) performed ortholog assignment, functional enrichment analysis using anvi'o; (3) constructed phylogenetic trees; and (4) measured gene flow based on PopCOGenT. Results of the analysis are available on Zenodo:
